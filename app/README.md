## Running the app
The application needs a .txt file with commands to execute. The .txt file can be provided through application arguments or interactively provided in the application. 

- To run the application with a provided text file: ./gradlew run --args="/path/to/the/commands.txt"
- To run the application and provide the path interactively: ./gradlew run

## Testing
To execute the tests it's preferable to do that within IntelliJ due to the usage of Junit platform.
It is also possible to run the tests through ./gradlew test
